# smart-flappy-bird

Flappy Bird combined with artificial intelligence

This is a project I have worked on during my school internship in 2018. I was tasked with creating a Flappy Bird clone using javascript.
I used p5.js as the drawing library.

Since I created a neuralnetwork library in Java before, I decided to reimplement it in Javascript and train the birds to fly automatically.
This worked really good (after ~750 pipes I stopped the program). Because it worked so good I decided to add more obstacles to make it harded.
The result was another bird (an angry bird) also flying in the same direction as the flappy bird but a bit slower. So you dont just have to avoid the pipes
but also the other birds. This makes it significantly harder.

I created this project before I knew about `git`. That is the reason why there are three different versions.
